# welcome to frame

we got bored. so we made this!

# usage

`1.png`, etc are image files used for the background. the html and filenames can be changed accordingly

## features

- this clock will automatically set itself to the correct time zone of the visitor
- the watermark at the bottom left can be changed to match to whoever the host is
- the `main.js` file has config options for announcements, and automatically cycles
- `index.html` can always have more than 10 images, just copy another line and modify it
